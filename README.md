Repository for the Tavernlight Games interview trial

Hello! Welcome to my repository! I've placed everything in their respective folders with READMEs to keep everything organized.

So far I'm really enjoying working with these systems! I can definitely say it's not like other things I've worked with so far,
but luckily after working with Meta's SDKs I'm used to minimal documentation!
